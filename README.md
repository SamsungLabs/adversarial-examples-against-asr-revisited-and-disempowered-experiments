# adversarial-examples-against-asr-revisited-and-disempowered-experiments
Repository representing the experiments of "Did You Hear That? We Heard a Disturbing Noise! Adversarial Examples Against Automatic Speech Recognition: Revisited and Disempowered" paper.

## Setup
The code is adjusted for python3.7.

After cloning, just run:
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
After that, you can reproduce our results with:
```
python3 main_tests.py
```
Be aware that it'll take about 5 days to complete (depends on your machine).
